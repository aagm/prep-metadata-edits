    "description": "The Puget Sound region is projected to warm rapidly during the 21st century. Prior to mid-century, the projected increase in air temperatures is about the same for all greenhouse gas scenarios, a result of the fact that a certain amount of warming is already “locked in” due to past emissions. After about 2050, projected warming depends on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted globally in the coming decades. For the 2050s (2040-2069, relative to 1970-1999), annual average air temperature is projected to rise +4.2°F to +5.9°F, on average, for a low (RCP 4.5) and a high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas scenario. These indicators are derived from the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) CMIP5 Future Climate Dataset from the University of Idaho.
