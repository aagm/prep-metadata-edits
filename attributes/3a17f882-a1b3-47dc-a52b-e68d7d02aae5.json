    "description": "Air temperatures are increasing in the Puget Sound region. The lowland areas surrounding Puget Sound warmed about +1.3°F (range: +0.7°F to +1.9°F) between 1895 and 2014, with statistically significant warming occurring in all seasons except for spring. These trends were determined using data from the U.S. Climate Divisional Dataset, developed by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). NCEI provides long-term climate summaries for each of the country’s 344 climate divisions. Results for the “Puget Sound Lowlands (45-03)” climate division were used in the present analysis, which includes all of the low-lying land areas surrounding Puget Sound, where most of the historical weather observations are concentrated. For more information about this analysis please see http://cses.washington.edu/picea/mauger/ps-sok/ps-sok_sec12_builtenvironment_2015.pdf.
