    "short-description": "The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a way of measuring drought that is different from the Palmer drought index (PDI). Like the PDI, this index is negative for drought, and positive for wet conditions. But the SPI is a probability index that considers only precipitation, while Palmer's indices are water balance indices that consider water supply (precipitation), demand (evapotranspiration) and loss (runoff).
