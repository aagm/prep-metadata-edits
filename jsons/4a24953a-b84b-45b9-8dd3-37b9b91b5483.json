    "description": "The OLR is estimated directly from the HIRS radiance observations for all sky conditions. The observations from imagers onboard international operational geostationary satellites are incorporated to improve the sampling of the OLR diurnal variation. The Daily OLR CDR is at its initial version 1.2. The data file format is netCDF-4 with CF metadata, and it is accompanied by algorithm documentation, data flow diagram and source code for the NOAA CDR Program.",
