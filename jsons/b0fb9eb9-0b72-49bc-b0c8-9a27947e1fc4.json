    "description": "NLCD92 is based primarily on the unsupervised classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) circa 1990's satellite data. Other ancillary data sources used to generate these data included topography, census, and agricultural statistics, soil characteristics, and other types of land cover and wetland maps. NLCD1992 is the only NLCD dataset that can be downloaded by state and by user defined area from the MRLC Consortium Viewer. NOTE: NLCD 1992 is not recommended for direct comparisons with any subsequent NLCD data products (i.e. NLCD 2001, NLCD 2006, NLCD 2011). The typical result of direct comparison will result in a change map showing differences between legends and mapping methods rather than real changes on the ground.",
