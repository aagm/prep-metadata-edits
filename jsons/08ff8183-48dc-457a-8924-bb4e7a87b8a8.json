    "short-description": "This data consists of a composite inundation hazards layer for counties from TX to ME, which have a flood exposure snapshot. The dataset was developed from a union of FEMA flood hazard, USACE hurricane evacuation study, NOAA sea level rise of 3-ft above MHHW, and NOAA Shallow Coastal flooding georeferenced digital data. The source and date have been preserved for each source dataset in the attribution. A unique identifier for each hazard, a total number of hazards and hazard description list in the attribution provide coastal risk exposure for each polygon ",
