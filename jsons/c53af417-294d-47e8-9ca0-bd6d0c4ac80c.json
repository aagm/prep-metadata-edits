    "description": "The data set was derived using a multispectral HIRS OLR algorithm on the HIRS level 1b dataset from the TIROS-N to NOAA-19 series satellites with inter-satellite and radiance calibration adjustments employing an empirical diurnal model for the monthly mean derivation. The data file format is netCDF-4 with CF metadata, and it is accompanied by algorithm documentation, data flow diagram and source code for the NOAA CDR Program.",
